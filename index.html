		<p class="paragraph">
			My name is Joshua Faulstroh. I am currently majoring in Cybersecurity, and am planning to minor in Management and 
			Operations in the future. I moved to Joliet from Momence in July. Joliet is my home town; however, I lived in Momence 
			from August 2011 - June 2023.

	<h3 class="header">What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
		<p>In taking Intro to Computer Science, I hope to:</p>
	<ul class="square-list">
		<li>Learn how to better my coding skills.</li>	
		<li>Better my knowledge regarding computers as well as their hardware and software components.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="header">My favorite Activities/Hobbies</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">
			I love listening to music. During my freshman year of high school, classic rock really grew onto me. Since then, I have had <br>
			phases where I liked rap. Not current rap, but 90s hip hop and artists that have a similar sound to it. Classic rock is what <br>
			influenced me to get and staert playing a guitar. The songs Eric Johnson's "Cliffs of Dover" and Van Halen's "Eruption" are <br>
			the two main pieces that influenced me to get a guitar. Aside from guitar, another hobby of mine is photography. For the past <br>
			five years, I have only really been using my phone camera to take pictures of mostly nature and buildings. I hope to get a <br>
			full-fledged camera soon where I can bring my pictures to a new level of detail and color.

	<h5 class="header">A Fun Fact About Myself</h5>
		<p class="paragraph">
			I am currently learning Japanese, as I plan to take a trip to Japan in the coming years. In the recent past, I have been very <br>
			interested in visiting many places in Japan such as Kyoto, Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, and many more. The culture itself has been of <br>
			interest to me as well. As of right now, I can read and write in hiragana, which is one of three Japanese writing systems. The <br>
			other two are katakana and kanji, which I am making progress in, but still have yet to fully learn.
