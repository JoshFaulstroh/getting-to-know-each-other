<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Joshua Faulstroh. I am currently majoring in Cybersecurity, and may be minoring in astrophysics or something related in the future. I moved to Joliet from Momence in July. Joliet is my home town; however, I lived in Momence from August 2011-June 2023.</p>
<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<p>In taking Intro to Computer Science, I hope to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Learn how to better my coding skills.</li>	
<li>Better my knowledge regarding computers as well as their hardware and software components.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My favorite Activities/Hobbies</h2>
<p>I love listening to music. During my freshman year of high school, classic rock really grew onto me. Since then, I have had phases where I liked rap. Not current rap, but 90s hip hop and artists that have a similar sound to it. Classic rock is what influenced me to get and staert playing a guitar. The songs Eric Johnson's "Cliffs of Dover" and Van Halen's "Eruption" are the two main pieces that influenced me to get a guitar. Aside from guitar, another hobby of mine is photography. For the past five years, I have only really been using my phone camera to take pictures of mostly nature and buildings. I hope to get a full-fledged camera soon where I can bring my pictures to a new level of detail and color.</p>
<h2>A Fun Fact About Myself</h2>
<p>I am currently learning Japanese, as I plan to take a trip to Japan in the coming years. In the recent past, I have been very interested in visiting many places in Japan such as Kyoto, Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, and many more. The culture itself has been of interest to me as well. As of right now, I can read and write in hiragana, which is one of three Japanese writing systems. The other two are katakana and kanji, which I am making progress in, but still have yet to fully learn.</p>
